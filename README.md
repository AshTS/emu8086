# 8088 Emulator

The goal of this project is to make an Intel 8088 emulator which is accurate enough to boot MS-DOS as an IBM PC compatible. As references throughout this process, I will be using the [Intel 8086 Family User's Manual](https://edge.edx.org/c4x/BITSPilani/EEE231/asset/8086_family_Users_Manual_1_.pdf), the [IBM 5150 Technical Reference](https://minuszerodegrees.net/manuals/IBM_5150_Technical_Reference_6322507_APR84.pdf), and various other pieces of documentation which will be noted when used. The emulator will be written in Rust. Any libraries used will be noted in the writeups. Anything which is part of the emulation process (decoding instructions, manipulating memory, any operations specific to a chip set, etc.) will be custom written, whereas other libraries will be utilized to keep the scope of the project well contained.
